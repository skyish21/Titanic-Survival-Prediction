# Titanic-Survival-Prediction  

## üìÑ **Problem Statement**  
The objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as class, sex, age, fare, and other passenger details. The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

---

## üìä **Dataset Description**  
The Titanic dataset contains the following key features:

| **Feature Name** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `PassengerId` | Unique identifier for each passenger |
| `Survived`    | Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| `Pclass`      | Passenger class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third) |
| `Name`        | Name of the passenger |
| `Sex`         | Gender (male or female) |
| `Age`         | Age of the passenger |
| `SibSp`       | Number of siblings/spouses aboard |
| `Parch`       | Number of parents/children aboard |
| `Ticket`      | Ticket number |
| `Fare`        | Fare paid |
| `Cabin`       | Cabin number |
| `Embarked`    | Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |

---

## üîß **Steps in the Solution**  

1. **Data Loading:**  
   Imported the Titanic dataset using `pandas`.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`.  
   - Dropped unnecessary columns (`PassengerId`, `Name`, and `Ticket`).  
   - Converted categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`) to numerical using label encoding.

3. **Feature Engineering:** 
   - Bucketed age into categories.  
   - Scaled numerical features using Standard Scaler.

4. **Model Selection and Training:**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Trained multiple machine learning models: 
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Logistic Regression  
   - Evaluated models using accuracy and confusion matrices.

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Achieved a training accuracy of **85%** using Random Forest.  
   - Tested models to determine their generalization ability.
